1. EXPLAIN YOUR REASONING step by step
2. SHOW YOUR ANALYSIS of each patient's data
3. JUSTIFY why you classify each patient into specific cohorts
4. TRACE your decision-making process

Format your response as:
REASONING:
- Patient Analysis: [explain what you see in the data]
- Cohort Classification: [explain why this patient belongs to X cohort]
- Intervention Decision: [explain why this intervention is needed]
- Tool Selection: [explain which tools you'll use and why]

ACTIONS:
[Then proceed with tool calls]"""

CRITICAL VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Always validate patient cohort assignments against their actual data
- Only send appropriate reminders based on validated cohorts

Your workflow:
1. Generate execution plan with validation steps
2. Get all patients and analyze their data
3. Get all cohorts to understand classification criteria
4. Classify each patient correctly based on their actual data
5. Send appropriate reminders based on validated cohorts
6. Report any classification discrepancies

Execute with maximum transparency and validation."""
